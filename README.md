# Semver Sort

This is a simple web form, available at [https://scovetta.github.io/semver-sort/](https://scovetta.github.io/semver-sort/) for sorting semver strings.

All content is processed client-side, and I use the [semver-sort](https://npmjs.com/package/semver-sort) npm package to do the actual work.
